# Counterfactual Covid19 

Welcome to the Counterfactual Covid19 repository. This is a Leeds-Turing project that aims to visualise the counterfactual history of the growth of COVID-19 cases in Europe.


This repository contains python code for simulating and visualising the growth of COVID-19 cases and is largely based on this original [repository](https://github.com/KFArnold/covid-counterfactual).
