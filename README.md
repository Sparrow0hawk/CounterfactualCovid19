# CounterfactualCovid19
Welcome to the Counterfactual Covid19 repository. This is a Leeds-Turing project that aims to visualise the counterfactual history of the growth of COVID-19 cases in Europe.


This repository contains two subdirectories:

* *counterfactual_calculations*: python code for simulating the growth of COVID-19 cases and is largely based on this original [repository](https://github.com/KFArnold/covid-counterfactual).
* *counterfactual_covid19-map*:  React code to build an iterative map based on this [repository](https://github.com/CodingWith-Adam/covid19-map)
