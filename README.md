# CounterfactualCovid19
Welcome to the Counterfactual Covid19 repository. This is a Leeds-Turing project that aims to visualise the counterfactual history of the growth of COVID-19 cases in Europe.

This repository contains two subdirectories:

* *counterfactual_calculations*:  This directory contains python code for simulating the growth of COVID-19 cases and is largely based on this original [repository](https://github.com/KFArnold/covid-counterfactual).
* *counterfactual_covid19_map*: This directory contains react-leaflet code to visualise the COVID-19 data and counterfactual simulations.
